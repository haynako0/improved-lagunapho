# Laguna Provincial Health Office FAQ Chatbot

## 📘 Project Overview

This is a **rule-based FAQ chatbot** developed for the **Laguna Provincial Health Office Record Management System**. It is designed to assist users by answering frequently asked questions related to records, processes, and health office operations.

## ⚠️ File Hosting Limitation

Due to the size of the chatbot files—estimated at **2GB to 3GB**—we are **unable to host the complete project on GitHub**, as it exceeds the platform’s limitations:

- GitHub restricts individual file uploads to **100MB**.
- Git Large File Storage (LFS) is also limited to **1GB** on free accounts, which is still insufficient for our use case.

## 📥 Alternative Download

- The download may take several minutes due to the file size.
- Installation and setup instructions are included in the downloaded package.
